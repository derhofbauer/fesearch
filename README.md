Frontend Search Extension for Typo3

This Extension is planned to only provide a plugin to include a searchbox and filter content elements on input. There is no backend search, just Javascript.

Planned features include:
* Option to make CEs sticky, so they don't get hidden, even if the searchterm is not found within them
* Option to only search CEs beneath the searchbox
* Option to not filter CEs but Elements matching a custom selector
* Option to highlight the searchterm in the filtered elements
